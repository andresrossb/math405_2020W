Questions about the course should normally be posted on [PIAZZA](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/55324/external_tools/201?display=borderless) so that the entire group can benefit from the discussion. Please email the instructor only in exceptional circumstances, e.g. when an issue is clearly private.

Lectures and workshops are 
* Tuesday 1400-1530
